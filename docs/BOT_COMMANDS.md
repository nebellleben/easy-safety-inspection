- **Bad:** "Near the machines"
- **Good:** "Workshop, Station 3, near the emergency stop"

### 3. Choose Correct Severity
- **Low**: Minor issues that don't pose immediate risk
- **Medium**: Issues that should be fixed within a few days
- **High**: Serious concerns that need attention today
- **Critical**: Immediate danger - stop work and report now

### 4. Use Photos
Photos help admins understand the issue better. After describing your issue, you'll be prompted to upload a photo. You can also type "skip" to continue without a photo.
